Feature: POST: To Test the feature of IFSC MICR API
Description:The Purpose of this api to fetch the deatis of IFSC and MICR

@Post
Scenario Outline: To test the functionality of IFSC MICR Api when we pass the valid
                  IFSC code 
    Given I want to set the initial End Point URL as "<URL>" for test case "<TestName>"
    When I set header as "<Headers>"
    When I hit the API with requestbody and Post method "<RequestBody>"
    Then I try to verify response status code is "<StatusCode>" 
    And I try to validate the response time response type and response app id
    And I want to validate if response body contains specific string "bnkmicrCode" and "bnkIfscCode"
   
    Examples:
    
      | TestName          |    URL              |  Headers                                         | RequestBody        | StatusCode |

    Then I try to verify response status code is "<StatusCode>"
