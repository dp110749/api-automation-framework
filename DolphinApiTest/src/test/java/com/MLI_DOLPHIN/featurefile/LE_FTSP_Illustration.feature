@LE_IllustrationGenerator
Feature: POST: LE FTSP service for Illustation generator and premium generator 
Description:The Purpose of this api to generate the illustration of FTSP product

Scenario Outline: To test the functionality of LE FTSP API when we pass the valid 
          Request
    Given I wnat to set the request end Point url for "<URL>" for test case "<TestName>"
    When I set the header "<Headers>"
    When I send the complete request body for "<RequestBody>"
    Then I verify the response status code "<StatusCode>"
    And I try to validate the generated illustration is not empty
    And I try to validate the response time response type and response app id for LE FTSP
    And I try to validate response  message  discription "Illustration generated" and correlation id "31873127329799381273192121"
      
    Examples:    
    | TestName                |             URL                                                |  Headers                                         | RequestBody                        | StatusCode |

    When I send the complete request body for "<RequestBody>" and pass the name of insured as empty key is "<insuredNameKey>" and value "<insuredValue>"
    Then I verify the response status code "<StatusCode>"
    And I try to validate the response time response type and response app id for LE FTSP
    And I try to validate response  message  discription "Faliure" and correlation id "31873127329799381273192121"
